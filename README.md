-------------------------

The purpose of this project was to make a mahjong game for free online. Initial plans for the project is to make it client side only. Players will only be able to play with each other locally. The program will also include an AI so the player can play against bots with different difficulties. Plans to make games playable across multiple computers

This Node.js application uses Socket.io and Express to synchronize actions of players in the same room. Currently, what is finished is the general gameplay of drawing and discarding tiles. Objects are used to define tiles and players. This app was built entirely from vanilla JavaScript. Features currently include dragging and dropping tiles into the middle to play tiles, the ability to swap tiles within your hand, and being able to "Pong", "Seung", or "Gong".

No AI levels have been implemented yet (although there is an option to select it). Game completion conditions needs to be added and a point calculating system.
